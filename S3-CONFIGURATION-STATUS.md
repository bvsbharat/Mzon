# AWS S3 Configuration Status

## ✅ Configuration Complete

Your Mzon application has been successfully configured with AWS S3 storage!

### **S3 Bucket Details:**
- **Bucket Name**: `mzon-user-images-1758174093`
- **Region**: `us-east-1`
- **Status**: Active and ready to use

### **Environment Variables Configured:**
- ✅ **Local (.env.local)**:
  - `VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1`
  - `VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA***[configured]`
  - `VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***[configured]`
  - `VITE_AWS_S3_BUCKET=mzon-user-images-1758174093`

- ✅ **Production (Vercel)**:
  - All environment variables deployed to Vercel production
  - New deployment completed with S3 integration

### **Application Features:**
- 🔄 **Automatic Storage**: Images are automatically uploaded to S3
- 📁 **Organized Structure**: Files stored in folders by type and date
- 🛡️ **Fallback System**: Falls back to local storage if S3 fails
- 🔍 **Status Monitoring**: StorageStatus component shows configuration
- 🗑️ **Smart Cleanup**: Deletes from S3 when images are removed

### **Live URLs:**
- **Production App**: https://mzon-studio-131f76stw-bvsbharats-projects.vercel.app
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/bvsbharats-projects/mzon-studio

### **Image Storage Structure:**
```

```

### **How It Works:**
1. User generates/uploads an image in any studio
2. App automatically uploads to S3 with public-read access
3. S3 URL is stored in image library instead of data URL
4. Images load faster and don't consume browser memory
5. If S3 fails, app gracefully falls back to data URLs

### **Testing the Integration:**
1. Visit your app: https://mzon-studio-131f76stw-bvsbharats-projects.vercel.app
2. Generate an image in any studio (Photo Studio, Image Generator, etc.)
3. Check the notification - it should say "saved to cloud storage"
4. View your S3 bucket to see the uploaded files

### **Cost Information:**
- **Storage**: ~$0.023 per GB per month
- **Requests**: ~$0.005 per 1,000 uploads
- **Estimated monthly cost**: Under $1 for typical usage (100 images/month)

### **IAM Permissions Note:**
The current IAM user has basic S3 access. For enhanced security in production, consider:
- Creating a more restricted IAM policy with only necessary permissions
- Using IAM roles instead of access keys when hosting on AWS infrastructure
- Setting up CloudFront for better performance and security

### **Monitoring:**
- Check the StorageStatus component in your app (bottom-right corner)
- Monitor S3 bucket usage in AWS console
- Watch Vercel deployment logs for any storage errors
