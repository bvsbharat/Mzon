You have been provided with exactly two images:
   - **Image 1 (The Product):** This is the primary product/object that must be featured in the final scene.
   - **Image 2 (The Context Sheet):** This image is a collage containing one or more context items (e.g., models, backgrounds, props). You must extract the necessary elements from this sheet to build the scene.

**User's Instructions:**

**Your Goal:**
Follow the user's instructions precisely. Use **Image 1** as the main subject and use elements from **Image 2** to construct the final, seamless, photorealistic scene.

**Execution Scenarios:**
-   **Arrangement:** If the user asks to arrange items, take the product from **Image 1** and the required items from the context sheet in **Image 2** and place them into a new scene according to the instructions.
-   **Replacement/Editing:** If the user asks to replace an object from the context sheet with the product from Image 1 (e.g., "make the model hold the perfume"), you must perform this edit flawlessly.

**ABSOLUTE CRITICAL RULES - NON-NEGOTIABLE:**
1.  **OUTPUT A SINGLE IMAGE:** You MUST return ONLY ONE final, composed image.
2.  **DO NOT INCLUDE SOURCE IMAGES:** Your output must NOT contain the original **Image 1** (the product) or **Image 2** (the context sheet). The user wants to see ONLY the final result, not the ingredients.
3.  **MAINTAIN 1:1 ASPECT RATIO:** The final image must be a 1080x1080 square.
4.  **NO TEXT OR ARTIFACTS:** Do not add any text, labels, watermarks, or borders to the image.

Analyze the two images and the user's prompt, then generate the single, final, final, composed image.`;

2.  **Deconstruct User Intent:** Analyze the User's Prompt to understand the exact modification they want. This is the *only* change you should describe.
3.  **Contextual Analysis:** Observe the lighting, shadows, and textures immediately surrounding the highlighted object to ensure the final edit will be seamless.
4.  **Synthesize the Preservation-Focused Prompt:** Rewrite the user's prompt with the following strict rules:
    a.   **Explicitly preserve the object's core identity.** Your prompt should guide the AI to *modify* the existing object, not replace it. Mention the specific object identified in Step 1.
    b.   **Integrate the user's modification.** Clearly state the change from Step 2.
    c.   **Add contextual details.** Weave in the lighting, shadow, and material details from Step 3 to ensure a photorealistic blend.
    d.   **DO NOT add or invent new objects or change fundamental characteristics (like logos or shape) unless the user explicitly asks for it.**

**Example:**
-   **Hint Image:** A man wearing a black cap with a white Jordan logo. The cap is highlighted.
-   **User's Prompt:** "change this to grey"
-   **Your Improved Prompt:** "Change the color of the black Jordan baseball cap to a neutral grey, carefully preserving the original fabric texture, the white logo, and matching the soft, warm outdoor lighting of the scene."
